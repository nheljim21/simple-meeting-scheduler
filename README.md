## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Page layout and form structure
- **CSS3** – Basic styling (embedded in the same HTML file)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – Simple interaction for scheduling confirmation

## 📌 Notes

- This is a static prototype — no backend or persistent data.
- Time slots are hard-coded and not dynamically generated.
- You can easily adapt this to include real calendar integration or time zone support.
